## How It Works

### 1. Upload an Image
- Users can upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format using the file uploader provided in the app interface.

### 2. Image Processing
- Once an image is uploaded, the application uses a pre-trained image captioning model to analyze the content of the image. The model employed in SnapCaption is the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model, which is capable of generating descriptive captions based on the visual content.

### 3. Generate Caption
- After the image is processed, users can click the "Generate Caption" button. The application will:
  - Preprocess the uploaded image.
  - Use the BLIP model to generate a caption without calculating gradients (to optimize performance).
  - Decode the generated caption into a human-readable format.

### 4. Display the Caption
- The generated caption is displayed on the app interface. Additionally, the app provides a suggested status format that includes the caption along with relevant hashtags for social media sharing.
